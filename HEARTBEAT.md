- **SiteGround DNS records added:**
  - `TXT @` → `brevo-code:7340efc9305ab1dd31be3f9998ef2be8`
  - `CNAME brevo1._domainkey` → `b1.mctvofms-com.dkim.brevo.com`

### 2026-02-26 — PWA Support + Test Client (`e4d4bf1`)

Progressive Web App layer enabling "Add to Home Screen" on mobile devices, with mobile-responsive CSS and offline-capable service worker.

#### New Files
- **`services/pwa.py`** — PWA injection helper: `inject_pwa()` (manifest link, meta tags, SW registration, mobile CSS), `inject_install_banner()` (dismissible "Add to Home Screen" banner). Handles iOS Safari, Chrome/Edge, and Android browsers.
- **`static/manifest.json`** — Web app manifest: MCTV branding (navy #1B2A4A), 8 icon sizes (72-512px), display standalone, 3 shortcuts (Contracts, Invoices, Creative Requests).
- **`static/service-worker.js`** — Cache-first for static assets (icons, fonts, images), network-first with cache fallback for data/pages, offline fallback to cached home page. Pre-caches critical assets on install.
- **`static/icons/icon-{72,96,128,144,152,192,384,512}x{size}.png`** — Generated from `mctv_logo_on_navy.png` using Pillow. Navy background with centered logo at 75% size.
- **`scripts/setup_test_client.py`** — Portal QA test data generator. Creates "Oxford Coffee Co." with: 1 client, 1 Supabase Auth user (`test@mctvofms.com` / `MCTVtest2026!`), 2 contracts (1 awaiting signature, 1 active), 3 invoices (pending, paid, overdue), 2 creative requests, 1 traction report, 6 activity log entries.

#### Modified Files
- **`app.py`** — Added `mimetypes.add_type()` fix for Windows `.js` → `text/plain` registry issue. Patched `SAFE_APP_STATIC_FILE_EXTENSIONS` in both `app_static_file_handler` and `starlette_routes` modules to serve `.js` as `application/javascript`. Added `inject_pwa()` and `inject_install_banner()` calls.
- **`services/portal_ui.py`** — Added `inject_pwa()` call inside `inject_portal_css()` so all portal pages automatically get PWA support.
- **`pages/portal_dashboard.py`** — Added `inject_install_banner()` for mobile install prompt.
- **`.streamlit/config.toml`** — Added `enableStaticServing = true` to serve PWA files from `static/` directory at `/app/static/`.

#### Technical Notes
- Streamlit intentionally forces `Content-Type: text/plain` for `.js` files via `SAFE_APP_STATIC_FILE_EXTENSIONS` allowlist — required dual patch (base module + Starlette routes copy)
- Windows registry maps `.js` to `text/plain` — `mimetypes.add_type()` fix needed for `FileResponse` fallback
- `components.html()` runs in iframe — SW registration uses `window.parent.navigator.serviceWorker` with try/catch fallback
- SW scope limited to `/app/static/` (Streamlit's static serving path). Root scope requires `Service-Worker-Allowed: /` header (future: Render custom headers or reverse proxy)
- Install banner detects iOS (Share → Add to Home Screen) vs Android (Menu → Install App) and provides manual instructions

### 2026-02-24 — SMS Messaging System (`4a37c90`)

Full Twilio SMS integration with TCPA-compliant consent management. Dashboard ready — activates when Twilio credentials are added.

#### New Files
- **`services/sms_service.py`** — Core SMS engine: Twilio client management, `format_phone()` (any format → E.164), `set_consent()` / `check_consent()` / `get_all_consent()` (Supabase + local JSON fallback), `send_sms()` (consent enforcement, auto-appends STOP, logs history), `send_template()` (variable substitution). 8 built-in templates: proposal_sent, follow_up_3day, traction_report, invoice_reminder, contract_ready, welcome_new_client, creative_live, host_check_in.
- **`pages/12_Messaging.py`** — 4-tab SMS dashboard: Compose (contact picker from leads/clients, consent check, char/segment counter), Quick Templates (selector, auto-fill, live preview), Opt-In Management (add/bulk opt-in, consent records viewer), Message History (expandable log with status icons).

#### Modified Files
- **`services/notification_service.py`** — Added SMS counterparts for all email notifications: `_try_sms()` generic helper, `sms_proposal_sent()`, `sms_contract_ready()`, `sms_invoice_reminder()`, `sms_welcome_client()`, `sms_creative_live()`, `sms_traction_report()`. All fail silently if Twilio not configured.
- **`requirements.txt`** — Added `twilio>=9.0.0`
- **`.env`** — Added Twilio placeholders: `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`, `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`, `TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER`
- **`app.py`** — Added SMS Messaging to sidebar navigation

### 2026-02-23 — V4: Dashboard Integration + Photo System Phase 1 (`75af231`)

12 files changed, 357 insertions, 49 deletions.

#### Traction Report — Network Dashboard Integration
- **`services/excel_parser.py`** — New `parse_network_dashboard()` reads "All MCTV Hosts" sheet from MCTV Network Dashboard Excel (97 venues). New `enrich_report_with_dashboard()` matches venues by lowercase host_name and populates traffic, dwell time, impressions, screen count.
- **Impression formula**: `Impressions = Traffic × Dwell Time × License Count / 15` (verified 100% match across all 97 venues — `/15` is the ad loop rotation)
- **`generators/advertiser_report.py`** — Dynamic Impressions + CPM columns in venue table. CPM uses proportional cost allocation. KPI grid shows impressions + avg dwell time when dashboard available.
- **`models/report_data.py`** — Added `monthly_rate: float` to `TractionReportInput`
- **`pages/2_Reports.py`** — Dashboard upload field, monthly rate input (for CPM), match rate metric, enrichment pipeline

#### Traction Report — Team Section Logo
- Dark mode team section now uses `mctv_logo_white.png` (white text, transparent bg) instead of `mctv_logo_on_navy.png` (low-res baked navy)
- Fallback chain: `mctv_logo_white.png` → `cover_logo` from config → `mctv_logo.png`

#### Photo System Phase 1 (from MCTV_Photo_Handling_Spec.md)
- Page 2 max photos: 2 → 4
- **Responsive layouts in `docx_service.py`**: 1=centered 3.0", 2=side-by-side 2.8", 3=2+1 merged bottom row (cell merge), 4=2×2 grid
- All 6 generators: `PHOTO_DISTRIBUTION` max: 2→4
- `pages/1_Proposals.py`: Pipeline caps `[:2]`→`[:4]`, UI labels "up to 4 hero showcase photos", warning threshold `>4`

#### Files Modified
- `generators/advertiser_report.py` — table split, impressions/CPM columns, KPI updates, AI insights enrichment
- `services/docx_service.py` — white logo fallback, responsive 1-4 photo layouts
- `services/excel_parser.py` — `parse_network_dashboard()`, `enrich_report_with_dashboard()`

### 2026-02-23 — Proposal v2 Fixes (`a6254f9`) + Traction Report v2 Fixes (`3dadf11`)

10-item traction report fix spec across 3 phases (padding, borders, photo routing, selling points for proposals; 10 items for reports).

---

### 2026-02-23 — Traction Report v2 (Gold Standard Upgrade)

15-item spec (Spec B) bringing auto-generated traction reports up to the manually-built RedMed/Stout's/Paysinger gold standard. Previously the report was non-functional (0 plays everywhere).

#### Phase 1: SHOW-STOPPER Fixes
- **B-1.1/1.2: Play count + duration parser fix** — `parse_per_content_report()` rewrote from hardcoded column indices (assumed 6-col) to header-name-based column mapping. NTV360 10-column format (`Host|City|State|Zip|Region|Playlist|Play Count|Play Duration|Start|End`) now parsed correctly. Magnolia Rental: 0 plays → 32,318 plays.
- **B-1.3: Demo venue exclusion** — Auto-filters venues where host or playlist contains "demo" (case-insensitive) in all 3 parsers + `build_report_data()`. Removes "D.476 Dealer Demo" test entries from client reports.
- **B-1.5: AI insights sanity check** — If total_plays == 0 but venues exist, shows data warning instead of letting Claude fabricate explanations for broken data.

#### Phase 2: Core Report Quality
- **B-1.4: Venue categorization engine** — `classify_venue()` function with 10 regex-based rules (Restaurant, Salon, Medical, Auto, Fitness, Liquor, Education, Professional, Retail, Community). Word-boundary-aware to avoid false positives ("Oxford" no longer matches "ford"). Applied automatically in `build_report_data()`.
- **B-2.1: Executive Summary + KPI grid** — Replaced text-only title block with `docx.add_metrics_banner()` (Total Plays, Active Venues, Screen Time, Avg Plays/Venue) + narrative summary paragraph + campaign period callout box.
- **B-2.2: Performance Analytics (4 charts)** — New `services/chart_service.py` using matplotlib. Venue bar chart (horizontal, color-coded by market), category donut chart, engagement scatter plot (plays vs air time), market comparison (3 grouped bars). All in MCTV brand colors. Embedded as 2×2 grid via `add_photos_grid()`.
- **B-2.3: Data table enhancements** — Added City/Market column, bold top 3 performers (`bold_rows=3`), navy totals row at bottom. `add_data_table()` now accepts `bold_rows` and `totals_row` params.
- **B-2.5/2.6/2.7: Cover page + footer + section headers** — Reused shared design system from v21 proposals. `add_cover_page()` (navy bg, MCTV logo, advertiser name, campaign period), `add_footer(footer_text="Ad Performance Report")`, `add_section_header()` (navy bar + gold accent).
- **B-2.4: Team section** — Reused `add_team_section()` with closing text + MCTV logo + preparer-first ordering.

#### Phase 3: Polish
- **B-3.1: Multi-market breakdown** — `_get_market_breakdown()` groups venues by city, shows "Oxford: 59.5% | Tupelo: 40.5%" in summary. Charts color-coded by market.
- **B-3.2: Campaign period auto-detection** — Parses start/end dates from data rows, pre-fills UI field. User can override.
- **B-3.4: Multi-file support** — Already working via `all_records.extend()` in UI.

#### Files Modified/Created
- `services/excel_parser.py` — parser rewrite, classify_venue(), demo exclusion, city propagation, campaign auto-detect
- `generators/advertiser_report.py` — complete rewrite: cover page, exec summary, KPIs, charts, enhanced table, team section
- `models/report_data.py` — added `city` field to PlayRecord
- `services/chart_service.py` — NEW: 4 chart functions + generate_all_charts()
- `services/docx_service.py` — add_data_table() extended with bold_rows + totals_row
- `pages/2_Reports.py` — auto-detect campaign period, show markets/cities in summary
- `requirements.txt` — added matplotlib>=3.8.0

### 2026-02-23 — Proposal Generator v21 (MUC Gold Standard Upgrade)

14-item spec comparing auto-generated proposals against the manually-built Mississippi Urgent Care (MUC) gold standard. All 14 items implemented across 3 phases.

#### Phase 1: Ship-Blocking Bug Fixes
- **1A: Getting Started formatting fix** — `add_body_text()` pre-splits single-newline numbered items (`1.\n2.\n3.`) into separate `\n\n` blocks so ALL steps get bold navy formatting, not just step 1
- **1B: Image scraper classification** — new `classify_image()` in `web_scraper.py` auto-categorizes images as `logo`/`ad_example`/`product`/`skip`. Scraper UI upgraded from checkboxes to slot-assignment dropdowns. Auto-routes to correct photo slots (cover logo, venue photos, ad examples, extra photos). All 6 generator forms merge scraped routes with manual uploads.
- **1C: Blank page fix** — `add_photos_grid()` sets `space_before/after=Pt(0)` on image cells, `keep_with_next` on title paragraphs. `add_inline_photos()` spacing tightened.

#### Phase 2: Design Upgrades (Match MUC Standard)
- **2A: Full-width section header bars** — Replaced navy text + thin gold bar with full-width navy background table + white bold 16pt centered text + gold accent underline bar. Affects ALL 6 generators.
- **2B: New `add_accent_card()` method** — Light bg + thick gold left border (sz=24) + thin gray other borders + bold primary title 11pt + body text 10pt. Premium card look for feature lists.
- **2C: What's Included → accent cards** — Elite Advertiser's `_build_whats_included()` changed from `add_bullet_list()` to parsing "- Title: Description" into `add_accent_card()` calls.
- **2D: Why MCTV → accent cards** — Elite Advertiser's `_build_why_choose_mctv()` changed from `add_sub_header()` + `add_body_text()` to `add_accent_card()` calls.
- **2E: Footer branding** — "MCTV Elite Advertising | Confidential Partnership Proposal | Page X" center-aligned, 8pt, accent/gray colors. Optional `footer_text` param for reports.
- **2F: Page pacing** — Elite Advertiser only: page breaks before What's Included, Market Coverage, Why MCTV, Getting Started. Target 7-8 page layout.
- **2G: Team section closing** — After team cards: italic accent closing statement + MCTV logo (2.0in centered) + "www.mctvofms.com". Optional `closing_text` param.
- **2H: Team order** — `base_proposal.py` stores `preparer_name` on DocxService during cover build. `add_team_section()` reorders team array so sales rep appears first. Benefits all 6 generators automatically.

#### Phase 3: Polish & Features
- **3A: Scraper preview UI** — Already built in 1B (slot-assignment dropdowns with auto-suggested categories)
- **3B: Photo grid captions** — `add_photos_grid()` accepts optional `captions` list. Italic gray 8pt text beneath each photo in the same cell.
- **3C: Client logo on cover** — Verified: full path chain from upload/scrape → session state → docx_svc.client_logo_path → cover page render at 1.8in. Working.
- **3D: Dynamic presenter** — Verified: sales rep dropdown flows to cover page "Prepared by", Claude prompt variables, and team section ordering. Working.
- **3E: Venue photo library** — Created `assets/screens/{Oxford,Starkville,Tupelo,Columbus,West Point}/` subdirectories. Auto-include logic updated to pull from selected market subdirectories first, fallback to root `screens/` directory. Creed populates with venue photos.

#### Files Modified
- `services/docx_service.py` — section headers, accent cards, footer, team section, body text, photos, captions
- `generators/elite_advertiser.py` — accent cards, page breaks
- `generators/base_proposal.py` — preparer_name storage
- `services/web_scraper.py` — classify_image(), scraper filtering
- `pages/1_Proposals.py` — slot-assignment UI, photo routing for all 6 forms, market-aware screen photo auto-include
- `assets/screens/` — market subdirectories created (Oxford, Starkville, Tupelo, Columbus, West Point)
